## Opening (# mins)

> Note: Let people know where restrooms and kitchen are located, as needed.

#### Instructor Bio

Welcome to Data Science 101! Here's a bit about me:
> Provide your name and brief bio. your background in data science, any experience you've had with GA, and one "fun fact" about yourself.

#### Introduce Yourselves

Before we dive in, a bit about you!

> Have students introduce themselves: name, what brings them to GA (ask for their current career & any specific goals), & one "fun fact".

> **Example Exercise**: *Have students write these on google doc or google poll. Instructor can briefly demonstrate data science workflow by categorizing data, merging into CSV file,  pulling out features, etc.*


#### Our Expectations

- You're ready to take charge of your learning experience.
- You've installed Anaconda & Python 2.7.
- You're curious and excited about data science!

#### Our Objectives

> Note: Write workshop objectives on board before class

- Why this topic matters (general relevance)
- Why this topic rocks (interest/hook)

> Note: Tailor these 2 points to student interests. Relate to their career info & goals students described during attendance.
